Ways to link with HTML:
 priority order- inline >  external/internal
 for internal and external, whichever comes last is taken as the priority
   1. write css within HTML tags - inline CSS
    eg- <p style="font-size:12px; color: red"> this is red text with size 12px </p>
    *only this paragraph will have this format
   2. write it inside your html enclosed in the style tag to the head of the HTML document - internal CSS
    eg- <head> <style> p {font-size: 12px; color: orange} </style> </head>
    *all paragraphs will have this format 
   3. write a separate file with .css extension and use <link href= "name of file.css"> to the head of the HTML document - external CSS
    <head> <link rel= "stylesheet" href= "name of file.css> </head>
    *rel- specifies the relationship that the linked file has with the cource file
    *href- hypertext references used to provide a path to the css stylesheet which is to be linked

HTML element selection:
   1. element selector
    using the name of the element to be selected 
    eg- for a paragraph tag 
        p {properties}
    all paragraph elements will have this exact same formatting
   2. class selector
    using a class given to the element while writing the HTML <p class= "class_name"> </p>
    eg- .class_name {properties}
    *using this method for formatting, you need to add a dot before the class name
   3. id selector
    using a id given to the element while writing the HTML <p id= "id_name"> </p>
    eg- #id_name {properties}
    *using this method for formatting, you need to add a # bfore the id of that element
   4. attribute selector
    using an attribute used while writing the HTML 
    eg- <p attribute= value> </p>
      p[attribute = value] {properties}
    *using this method requires you to specify the element name followed by [attribute=value]
    *above css will select all the paragraphs wich have type attributes value as text
